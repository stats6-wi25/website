Late work is not accepted except for homework assignments. 
On homework assignments if the submission is later than the due date and time, then 25% of the achieved total grade will be deducted for every 12 hours that the submission is late. 
For example, if you were to get 12 points out of 15 on a homework assignment and you submitted 15 hours late then your score would be 6 points.
It is recommended that you start working on the homework early and not leave it until the last minute to avoid any technological or personal issues.
Starting early would also give you ample opportunity to attend office hours.

It is possible that during the quarter, other events may affect your learning. This can be but not limited to sickness, religious holiday, attending a conference, playing professional sports, feeling down, flat tire, roommate issues, canceled/delayed flight, wanting to/needing to travel, or any other reason you can think of.  In such cases, you will be excused from two in-class quizzes with no questions asked. You do not need to email me about it. I would advise you to be mindful of that there are only 2 excused allowances for missing the quizzes. That already makes up about 10% of the quarter. Anything beyond 2 excused absences will be assigned zero. If you have an event going in your life that impacts your learning more than a week then I would advise you to talk to me (without waiting for the end of the quarter) to discuss your options.

Midterm and project are required components of the class and cannot be excused. For any needs regarding these assignments you can discuss it with me in a timely manner.
